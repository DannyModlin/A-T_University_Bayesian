# A-T_University_Bayesian

Welcome to our Bayesian Workshop hosted by NC A&T University.

Our time together will be divided across three topics of interest with Bayesian Analysis in SAS.

Hour 1:

Getting Started with Bayesian Analysis
This presentation introduces the audience to the realm of Bayesian analyses and concepts. Participants will be able to see the difference between the Bayesian approach and the classical approach to statistics. Convergence diagnostics, images, and a sample example of PROC MCMC will be shared.

Materials:
Please open the GS_Bayesian.pdf file to have access to and follow the slides that I will be presenting.

Hour 2:

PROC BGLIMM: The Smooth Transition to Bayesian Analysis 
Many analysts are interested in taking models they currently have and transitioning them to the Bayesian realm. Most leap from their favorite classical analysis procedure directly to PROC MCMC, the general-purpose Bayesian procedure. This presentation will feature the BGLIMM procedure available since SAS/STAT 15.1. This will allow the participant to model non-normal responses and include random effects within their Bayesian approach. Discussion will include options of priors and availability of statements. Examples will include models originally written in PROCs REG, GLM, GLMSELECT, GENMOD, MIXED, and GLIMMIX.

Materials:
Please open the BGLIMMComplete.pdf file to follow along with the presentation.
The file BGLIMMComplete.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook file that contains the slides and the SAS code that will be presented. This file can be uploaded into SAS Viya for Learners. You can also copy and paste the code items from the PDF directly into SAS VFL also.

Hour 3:

Missing Data in PROC MCMC
This presentation will show the participants how to incorporate missing data into the Bayesian analysis and not be subjected to complete case analysis. Posterior distributions for the missing values will be generated and the uncertainty of the missing will be captured within the final model.

Materials:
Please open the MCMC_Missing.pdf file to follow along with the presentation. The file MissingExample.pdf contains the example that we will be using during the presentation. The file MissingExample.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook file that contains the example. This file can be uploaded into SAS Viya for Learners. You can also copy and paste the code items from the PDF directly into SAS VFL also.
